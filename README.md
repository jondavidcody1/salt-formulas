salt-formulas
=============

A collection of [salt-formulas](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html). Right now only Debian based operating systems are supported.  To support other operating systems, only the map.jinja file of each formula needs to be updated.
